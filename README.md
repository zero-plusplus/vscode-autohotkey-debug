# Installation
1. Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with version `1.49.0` or higher
2. Install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
3. **Install an another extension to support AutoHotkey** (the famous [slevesque.vscode-autohotkey](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=slevesque.vscode-autohotkey), If you use v2, use [dudelmoser.vscode-autohotkey2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dudelmoser.vscode-autohotkey2), etc.)
4. Open VSCode, press `Ctrl + P` then type `ext install zero-plusplus.vscode-autohotkey-debug`

## For advanced users
This extension will work without configuration as long as you follow the steps above.

However, if you want to use a different version of AutoHotkey for which no installer is provided, you will need to configure it separately.

By default, the runtime is configured for each file extension as shown below, so please place the runtime in the same path.
* `ahk` - `C:/Program Files/AutoHotkey/AutoHotkey.exe`
* `ahk2` or `ah2` - `C:/Program Files/AutoHotkey/v2/AutoHotkey.exe`

If you want to place the runtime in a specified folder, you need to set the [runtime](https://github.com/zero-plusplus/vscode-autohotkey-debug/wiki/Launch-Mode) attribute in launch.json.

# Usage
1. Open a file with the extension `ahk`, `ahk2` or `ah2`.
2. (optional) Set [Breakpoint](https://github.com/zero-plusplus/vscode-autohotkey-debug/wiki/Breakpoint) where you want them
3. Press `F5`

If you want to enable more advanced features and make more detailed settings, please refer to [Debug configurations](https://github.com/zero-plusplus/vscode-autohotkey-debug/wiki/Debug-configurations).

If you need to run the script without debugging, choose `Run -> Run Without Debugging` from the menu or press `Ctrl + F5`.
