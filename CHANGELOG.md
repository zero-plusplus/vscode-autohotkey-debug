### Important Notices
This is a notification for people who debug using launch.json.
As of version 1.3.7, the `type` of launch.json has been changed from `ahk` to `autohotkey`.
This is to prevent it from being misinterpreted as a file extension.
You need to edit the launch.json as soon as possible.

### Changed
* Debugger type from `ahk` to `autohotkey`

### Changed
* You can jump to the output source by clicking on the file name to the right of the output, but only if you are outputting at a log point
* Supporting object values in conditional expressions

### Fixed
* When outputting a variable to the debug console, it may refer to a variable of a different scope
* Incorrectly displaying an object's overview
* We can't set the `obj.<base>` in the Watch expression, this is limited to v2. This is restricted to v2. (2020/06/27 This was a mistake and was retracted in 1.4.1)
* Can't rewrite the fields of an object
* If write an Integer, it will be treated as a Float
* The conditional breakpoint was not working

### Removed
* Message at the end of the debugging process Shows how long it took to debug. I didn't need it

## [1.3.1] - 2020-06-07
